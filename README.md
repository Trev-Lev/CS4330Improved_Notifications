# CS4330Improved_Notifications

Description: Improve upon the given file:

- Change the notification mechanism so that states are conveyed (you come up with the states) and make itpossible to detect when a thread has ended (either naturally or because ending the thread was requested).
- In the UI controller make it possible to click the buttons again after the thread the start has ended.
- Displaying “Start Task 1”, “Start Task 2”, “Start Task 3” and when clicked start their respective tasks. When a taskis running change the button to display “End Task 1” (or 2 or 3). When the “End Task n” button is displayed it canbe used to stop the task. When a task stops (either because it was clicked to stop or the task naturally ends" thelabel on the button should change to “Start Task n”.

This was my interpretation of the above.
